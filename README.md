# Hello-World
This is my github practice repository

I am a computer science and applied mathematics student, I am on my journey towards Machine Learning and AI, data analysis as well but main focus on Machine Learning
Engineering.

I started my journey a bit late due to unforseen circumstances but I will not let that deter me or get me down to achieve the goals I want to achieve in this industry and as a computer scientist.
